### here are few philosophies that I truly believe in and operate with – in no order. 
### by design, I have left lot to interpretation as I don’t want to lose the broader perspective by giving specific examples. 

1.	a relationship of
    * mutual respect and candor
    * trust and openness
  
2.	an environment, a culture, an ecosystem
    * to discuss and debate, a platform to disagree
    * that nurtures diversity in true form and appreciates different perspective
    * that cultivates innovation everyday
    * that understands urgency and accelerates decision making
3.	a mindset that goes beyond boundaries – geographical, organizational, team, etc
4.	invest in team
    * a belief in people, help grow and nurture, identify strength and be a multiplier, help with opportunities (and not use it to show down)
    * be a magnet for attracting best in class
    * build talent pipeline across all levels
    * believe in capabilities, not in title
5.	be an enabler, grow the community 
6.	be a global leader with local perspective and vice versa. 
    * Global leader with local perspective – tune in the local culture, needs and priorities. For eg. Education/ schools in india
    * Local leader with global perspective
7.	focus on organizational value, alignment to organization strategy, help influence/ define vision
